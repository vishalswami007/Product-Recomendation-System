# Product-Recommendation-Engine

## About the project
A collaborative product recommendation engine that uses data from an e-commerce store to make similar product suggestions based on the selected item. This is performed through community detection using Louvain clustering. A Flask API has been used to create the user interface and Gephi visualisations have been included to analyse the detected communities.

A product recommendation engine is essentially a software that records an userâ€™s actions on e-commerce websites and analyses the data obtained to make 
product suggestions that might interest the user. This can enhance the customer experience and even boost sales of the e-commerce website that makes use of it. 
Community detection can be used to identify products that are most likely to be bought together thereby facilitating a product recommendation engine. 
Here communities will be formed on the basis of the information obtained from user purchase patterns.
